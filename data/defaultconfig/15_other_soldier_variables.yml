  # after weigth goes over soldier carry capacity, the TUs will decrease linearly, down to 0 when he has soldierCarryCapacity * limitCarryCapacityMul KGs on his shoulder

    value: 2.0
    comment: "Soldier's carry capacity is multiplicated by this number to get the point at which a soldier will be left at 0 TUs"
