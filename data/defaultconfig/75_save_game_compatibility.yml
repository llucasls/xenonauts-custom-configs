# SAVE GAME COMPATIBILITY
  # This is primarily for being able to use XCE saves with official GH releases. Change the value only temporarily, using other formats for normal play will lose some data.

  # Allowed values are "xce" for Community Edition, "xce033" for X:CE 0.33, "gh107" for official release 1.07 (and up), and "gh15x" for official 1.5 release (and up).

  # This is mainly meant for testing and reporting bugs. It works even in Ironman mode, but if it is used to actually circumvent Ironman, that is obviously cheating.
