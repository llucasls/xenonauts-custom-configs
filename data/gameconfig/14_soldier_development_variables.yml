# SOLDIER DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES
- tag_name: soldierDevelopment
  # Soldiers develop their attributes by using them. Each time the soldier performs a certain action, he will gain a "progress point" in that attribute. Once he reaches the "pointsToProgress" value, the attribute will increase by one point. These progress points are cumulative and are stored from mission to mission.
